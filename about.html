  <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Roberto A. Cardenas</strong>, an IT professional transitioning into Cloud Engineering. With a strong foundation in finance and cybersecurity, I now build scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure on AWS using Terraform, Python, and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
  <p>I’m passionate about solving problems with infrastructure-as-code and deploying full-stack applications that run reliably in the cloud. I’m also working toward a broader goal of buying a ranch and launching a nonprofit initiative to give back.</p>
  <p>When I’m not coding or deploying infrastructure, you’ll find me studying cloud security, working on side projects, or exploring how to blend crypto and gaming technology.</p>
